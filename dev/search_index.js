This function can be used and/or extended in downstream packages (via @indirect import Module=UUID) without loading the package defining interface_function.  This works only at the top-level module.\n\nExamples\n\nStep 1: Declare indirect function in an upstream package\n\nThere must be a package that \"declares\" the ownership of an indirect function. Typically, such function is an interface extended by downstream packages.\n\nTo declare a function fun in a package Upstream,\n\nmodule Upstream\n    using IndirectImports\n    @indirect function fun end\nend\n\nStep 2: Add method definition in downstream packages\n\nFirst, find out the UUID of Upstream package by\n\njulia> using Upstream\n\njulia> Base.PkgId(Upstream)\nUpstream [332e404b-d707-4859-b48f-328b8b3632c0]\n\nUsing this UUID, the Upstream package can be indirectly imported and methods for the indirect function Upstream.fun can be defined as follows:\n\nmodule Downstream\n    using IndirectImports\n    @indirect import Upstream=\"332e404b-d707-4859-b48f-328b8b3632c0\"\n    @indirect Upstream.fun(x) = x + 1\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"macro"}]
